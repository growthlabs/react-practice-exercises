Update note: This tutorial has been updated to React Native 0.34 by Tom Elliot. The original tutorial was written by iOS Team member Colin Eberhardt.
In this React Native Tutorial you’ll learn about a framework for building native iOS and Android applications from Facebook, based on the same principals behind their hugely popular React Javascript Framework for building declarative user interfaces.
Over the years there have been many frameworks using JavaScript to create iOS applications (such as PhoneGap or Titanium), so what makes React Native special?
(Unlike PhoneGap) with React Native your application logic is written and runs in JavaScript, whereas your application UI is fully native; therefore you have none of the compromises typically associated with HTML5 UI.
Additionally (unlike Titanium), React introduces a novel, radical and highly functional approach to constructing user interfaces. In brief, the application UI is simply expressed as a function of the current application state.
The key point with React Native is that it aims to primarily bring the power of the React programming model to mobile app development. It is not aiming to be a cross platform, write-once run-anywhere, tool. It is aiming to be learn-once write-anywhere. An important distinction to make. 
This tutorial only covers iOS, but once you’ve learned the concepts here you could port that knowledge into creating an Android app very quickly.
